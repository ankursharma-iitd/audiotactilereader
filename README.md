--------------------

This is a project done under Prof. M. Balakrishnan by 6 second year Computer Sciecnce and Engineering IIT Delhi students.

Work Done - 
1. Desktop IDE to automate the process of Data creation.
2. Android App for live finger tracking and playing the corresponding audio.
3. Manual callibration for the Android App needs to be done for every page before starting to read the page.
4. Desktop IDE can store data only in form of .txt files or audio files.
5. Text to Speech is limited to English only.
6. Faces are detected in the Desktop IDE using a simple Angle method limited to only concave figures.

Extensions that can be added - 
1. Desktop IDE can also store data in form of a link. The actual data will be created by reading from this link.
2. Google translate can be integrated to increase the scope of Text to Speech.
3. Instead of manual callibration, automatic callibration can be added in the Android App.
4. Add a more complex method of face detection to include a wider range of convex figures too.
