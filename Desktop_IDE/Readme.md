DESKTOP IDE
-----------

The first half of the project is the data creation using the desktop IDE.

The process can be roughly divided into following steps - 
1. Opening a new book
2. Opening a SVG file (a new page in the book)
3. Converting the SVG file into DCEL (directly connected edge list)
4. Manually adding faces to the database (if required)
5. Mapping data to the desired faces.
6. Converting data in form of text file (if any) into audio files
7. Exporting the page so that all the relevant files are copied/created to the location specified
